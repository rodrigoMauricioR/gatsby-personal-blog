As this is my first blog entry, I'll keep it short and to the point.

While I can't promise that I will consistently post on here, I can guarantee that I will get it looking how I want to before I eventually forget about this project and never post again.

I plan to make this blog look more like I'm writing in a notebook. The corporate looking font will hopefully be gone by the time you are seeing this.

I don't have much to write about to I guess I can provide you with the some of the functionality of the markdown file I'm using to write this.

Such as:
[hyperlinks!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

> blockquotes!

```js
const text = "and codeblocks!"
```
Although there is much more I can show you, I would rather not waste your time with random blobs of text and images.

That's all for now, I hope you continue to read my future posts and updates!
